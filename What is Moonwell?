Moonwell is a DeFi protocol that enables users to lend, borrow, and manage digital assets through an intuitive interface, making decentralized finance accessible to both novices and experienced users. Deployed on Ethereum-compatible networks—Base, Optimism, Moonbeam, and Moonriver—Moonwell combines the scalability and low fees of Layer 2 solutions with robust financial tools. Its flagship offerings include single-sided liquidity pools, Morpho-integrated vaults, and the Moonwell Card, a VISA-backed card for spending crypto in the real world.

Founded with a mission to empower global users, Moonwell emphasizes simplicity, multilingual support, and community-driven governance. The protocol’s non-custodial architecture ensures users retain full control over their assets, while its transparent, onchain operations build trust in a space often criticized for complexity and opacity. Moonwell also supports innovative features like yield-generating vaults and cross-chain token transfers, making it a versatile platform for the onchain economy.
