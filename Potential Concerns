DeFi platforms carry inherent risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities. A past incident with Moonwell’s Base Safety Module, triggered by MIP-X28, resulted in a $285K loss in WELL tokens due to a reward-claiming bug, though staked funds were not at risk. The team proposed compensating affected users, demonstrating accountability. Users should verify the platform’s legitimacy, use secure wallets, and review Morpho’s risk documentation for vaults.
