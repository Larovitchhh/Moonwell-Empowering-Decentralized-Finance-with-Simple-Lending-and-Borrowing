Moonwell’s core functionality revolves around lending, borrowing, staking, and spending, all accessible through a streamlined app at moonwell.fi. Here’s how it operates:1. LendingUsers can lend assets into single-sided liquidity pools (money markets) to earn variable interest rates. Lending is the first step to borrowing, as supplied assets serve as collateral. Moonwell supports a variety of tokens, including USDC, ETH, and its native WELL token, with plans to expand asset offerings.

2. BorrowingAfter supplying assets, users can borrow other tokens against their collateral, leveraging Moonwell’s isolated lending markets for flexibility and risk management. The process is simple: select an asset to borrow from the Markets page, specify the amount, and confirm the transaction via a connected wallet.

3. Moonwell Morpho VaultsMoonwell’s collaboration with Morpho, Block Analitica, and B.Protocol introduces next-generation lending vaults built on the Morpho Blue protocol. These vaults accept single-asset deposits and dynamically allocate funds across markets to optimize returns while managing risk. Compliant with the ERC-4626 standard, Morpho Vaults offer improved capital efficiency, transparency, and security, with governance roles ensuring robust oversight.

4. Moonwell CardThe Moonwell Card, developed with Cypher WalletD Inc., bridges onchain finance with real-world spending. Accepted in over 180 countries, it allows users to spend USDC via VISA, Apple Pay, or Google Pay with no annual fees. The card supports automated top-ups and borrowing against supplied assets, with a 0.5% load fee and 1.5% for non-USD payments (USD payments are free). Users complete a streamlined KYC process to access digital and physical cards for seamless purchases.

5. Virtual AccountsMoonwell’s Virtual Accounts enable users to receive payments in USDC on Base or OP Mainnet, with virtual checking account and routing numbers for instant transactions. Users can deposit funds into the Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault to earn variable interest, view balances, and manage transactions via the Account Dashboard.

6. Staking and GovernanceThe WELL token powers Moonwell’s governance and staking ecosystem. Users can stake WELL to earn rewards and participate in gas-free governance via Snapshot voting. Proposals are enforced by a multisig, ensuring community alignment and resilience.

7. Cross-Chain TransfersMoonwell simplifies WELL token transfers between Base, OP Mainnet, and Moonbeam without external bridges, enhancing user convenience and reducing costs.

Potential ConcernsDeFi platforms carry inherent risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities. A past incident with Moonwell’s Base Safety Module, triggered by MIP-X28, resulted in a $285K loss in WELL tokens due to a reward-claiming bug, though staked funds were not at risk. The team proposed compensating affected users, demonstrating accountability. Users should verify the platform’s legitimacy, use secure wallets, and review Morpho’s risk documentation for vaults.
